{
{Memory Verbs} :
{Memory verbs are also known as memory semantics. In this communication style, the destination host registers a buffer in 
its memory space and passes control of that buffer to a source host.   The source host can then issue RDMA Read and Write 
operations, which allow reading from and writing to a remote memory, respectively. RDMA Atomic operations are also 
supported. These enable synchronization in distributed systems by ensuring atomicity via operations such as 
compare-and-swap and fetch-and-add performed on a remote memory. Some vendors offer additional proprietary enhancements 
as well.   Memory verbs operations do not require any confirmation from the remote machine because the sending side has 
visibility and control of the remote buffer. }
