{
{Infrastructure Upgrade } :
{Upgrade or replace network hardware to support Ethernet and RoCE. This may involve installing new Ethernet switches, 
network interface cards (NICs), and cabling. Implement data center bridging (DCB) features to ensure a lossless Ethernet 
environment suitable for RDMA. },

{Configuration and Optimization } :
{Configure the new Ethernet network for optimal performance, including setting up Quality of Service (QoS), Priority Flow 
Control (PFC), and other DCB features. Optimize RDMA settings and ensure all components are correctly configured to 
support RoCE. },

{Testing and Validation } :
{Thoroughly test the new Ethernet infrastructure to validate performance, latency, and throughput. Test key applications 
to ensure they perform as expected in the new environment. },

{Migration and Rollout } :
{Gradually migrate workloads from InfiniBand to Ethernet, starting with less critical applications to minimize risk. 
Monitor the performance and stability of the new setup and make the needed adjustments. },

{Training and Documentation } :
{Provide training for IT staff on the new Ethernet infrastructure and its management. Update documentation to reflect 
the new network architecture and configurations. }
