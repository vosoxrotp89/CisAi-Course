{Priority Flow Control } :
{Priority Flow Control was introduced in Layer 2 networks as the primary mechanism to enable lossless Ethernet. Flow control 
was driven by the class of service (CoS) value in the Layer 2 frame, and congestion is signaled and managed using pause 
frames, and a pause mechanism. However, building scalable Layer 2 networks can be challenging for network administrators.
Because of this, network designs have mostly evolved into Layer 3 routed fabrics.  To support traffic routing, PFC was 
adjusted to work with differentiated services code point (DSCP) priorities to signal congestion between routed hops in 
the network. Using Layer 3 marking enables traffic to maintain classification marking across routers.   Since PFC frames 
use local link addressing, the network devices can receive and perform pause signaling for routed and switched traffic. 
PFC is transmitted per hop, from the place of congestion to the traffic source. PFC is used as the primary tool to manage 
congestion for RoCEv2 transport. }
