{
{Enhanced Ethernet} :
{Achieves better fabric utilization by considering the load of the links to load balance the traffic. The network
maintains its state since flows can only be rebalanced when idle. },

{Ultra Ethernet} :
{Achieves even better fabric utilization than Enhanced Ethernet by using endpoint-controlled adaptive packet spraying. },

{scheduled Ethernet} :
{Enables fabric-controlled optimal load balancing with the &quot;spray and reorder&quot; method. It achieves maximum
performance by avoiding head-of-the-line (HoL) blocking and incast congestion avoidance. }
