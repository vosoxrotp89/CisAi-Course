{
{Link Layer} :
{Point-to-point link operations and switching within a local subnet. The Subnet Manager assigns a 16-bit Local ID (LID)
to all devices within a subnet.   All packets sent within a subnet use the LID for addressing. },

{Network Layer} :
{Responsible for packet routing. },

{Transport Layer} :
{Responsible for in-order packet delivery, partitioning, channel multiplexing, and transport services (reliable 
connection, reliable datagram, unreliable connection, unreliable datagram, raw datagram).  Part of the transport layer is 
also InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) Subnet Administration and Routing (SAR):  Subnet Administration: This involves managing 
the configuration and operation of the InfiniBand subnet, including tasks like assigning addresses, managing routing 
tables, and ensuring efficient data flow. Routing: InfiniBand uses a sophisticated routing mechanism to ensure data 
packets are delivered efficiently across the network. This includes both unicast and multicast routing. },

{Upper Layer} :
{Enables client transactions. }
