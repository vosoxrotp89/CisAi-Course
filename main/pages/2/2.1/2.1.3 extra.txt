{Operations} :
{An API-first design lets organizations use DevOps tools including HashiCorp Terraform and Red Hat Ansible to fully 
automate the provisioning and operations of their environment. },

{Management} :
{As a cloud management solution, Cisco Nexus HyperFabric provides a single point of configuration, monitoring, and 
maintenance of all tenant customer fabrics. It uses a real-time connection to switches deployed on-premises or in 
colocation facilities. Cisco automation and operations staff are responsible for the cloud controller, the fabric 
underlay network, and the software upgrade process. Organizations maintain direct control of all interconnections to 
their applications, hosts, and the rest of their network. },

{Monitoring} :
{Assertion-based monitoring continuously verifies the availability and reliability of the fabric and connected resources,
and the root cause of any issue detected is immediately identified. Self-service fabric tenancies empower host and 
application teams to monitor and manage the fabric services they have been allocated, removing their need to depend on IT
for most support services. }
