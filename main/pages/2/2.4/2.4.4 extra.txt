{Air Cooling} :
{Air cooling is considered the traditional way of cooling a data center. This method uses air conditioning, fans, and 
vents to keep the data center cool.   While air cooling is one of the more common ways to cool a data center, it is not
very energy efficient, resulting in fairly high-power usage. },

{Evaporative Cooling} :
{Evaporative cooling uses fans to draw in air and uses evaporation to cool the air before directing it toward the
equipment. This method can be more energy efficient than traditional methods, but it depends a reliable source of water.
Also, deploying an evaporating cooling system in an existing data center could be costly, requiring a significant overhaul
of the center. },

{Liquid Cooling} :
{Liquid cooling uses a technique that is very similar to the way a radiator cools a car engine. This method uses cool
liquid running through the data center to absorb heat. Liquid cooling is quickly becoming one of the most popular data 
center cooling methods. It is estimated that up to 40% of data centers use some type of liquid cooling.  With direct 
liquid cooling, the liquid passes through a manifold that is directly attached to the device. This method provides 
better heat removal than traditional air cooling, but it requires large amounts of local water and can cause environmental 
concerns if leaks occur.  Another form of liquid cooling, immersion cooling, submerses the computing devices into a 
non-conductive liquid. While this method is very effective, it is not very common due to the cost of implementation and 
other potential risks. }
